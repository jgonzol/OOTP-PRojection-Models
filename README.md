Projecting player performance using Random Forest

Out of the Park Baseball (OOTP) is a simulation baseball game that is great for anybody who loves baseball analytics or baseball roster management.

OOTP exports all kinds of data related to the simulation league. I use the data to try to project player performance.

I use player ratings, age, coach ratings, and even teammate ratings. The league itself has been simulated for about 15 seasons - the prior seasons are the data I use to fit the projection models.
